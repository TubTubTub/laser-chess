ASK ROBBO HOW TO GIVE SPECIFIC ARGS TO EACH SUPERCLASS WITH USING super()

Make game resize when fullscreen button pressed
Make CPU play rotational moves
Make bitboards a dictionary

Should do:
Make all widgets take in an event_type instead of event
Add empty event to widget group
Zobrist hashing (to check for threefold reptition)
Saving games (with SQL)
Viewing past games
Use RectF to prevent black lines in board forming from under-rounding errors
Extract repetitive code from states to use super() from bases
Refactor colour slider code (+ add hover colour change, colour slider thumb center does not jump to mouse position)
Set MOUSEBUTTONDOWN events to only left-click

Ambitious:
Cursor-based pagination for viewing games
Switch sphinx direction
Board creator
Log-in

Miscellaneous:
Multiple lasers firing at once
Maybe separate text background code into a new label class
Make new word wrap text class with text properties
Make widgets low-scale when scaling by just pygame transforming a copy
Add Ctrl + A and mouse drag to text input widget
