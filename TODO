Make CPU play rotational moves
Make bitboards a dictionary

Should do:
Add empty event to widget group
Zobrist hashing (to check for threefold reptition)
Use RectF to prevent black lines in board forming from under-rounding errors
Extract repetitive code from states to use super() from bases
Refactor colour slider code (+ add hover colour change, colour slider thumb center does not jump to mouse position)
Set MOUSEBUTTONDOWN events to only left-click
Make wrapper for pressable button widgets

Ambitious:
Switch sphinx direction
Log-in

Miscellaneous:
Maybe separate text background code into a new label class
Make new word wrap text class with text properties
Make widgets low-scale when scaling by just pygame transforming a copy
Add Ctrl + A and mouse drag to text input widget
Make ScrollArea use parent keyword
